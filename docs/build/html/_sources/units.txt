Units
=====

|project| units generally follow the |lammps_units|_, i.e.

    * Distance = angstroms
    * Energy = eV
    * force = eV/angstrom
    * Temperature = Kelvin
    * Time = picoseconds

Etc. including derived units like volume. Two notable exceptions are that **pressures are given in gigapascal** (e.g. in
:ref:`use_bulk_mod`) and **GB interfacial energies are given in millejoules per square meter (mJ/m^2)**.
