**Why does |project| call executables instead of, e.g. compiling LAMMPS as a library and running everything in Python,
wouldn't that be faster?**

Yes, it would almost certainly be faster! This is tentatively planned for the future. On a first pass, |project| was
optimized for ease of use rather than computational efficiency, and having access to a copy of LAMMPS is a lot more
likely than having access to LAMMPS compiled as a library.
