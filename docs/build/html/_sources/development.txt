Development
===========

This section contains the documentation for the source code itself. It will be particularly useful if you want to write
and extension for |project|, but is hopefully unnecessary for a regular user.

The only rule is that any new ``cgb_run_*`` calculation on the GB data should store results as a new |namespace|_
in ``Job.results``.

.. |namespace| replace:: ``Namespace``
.. _namespace: https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html#argparse.Namespace
